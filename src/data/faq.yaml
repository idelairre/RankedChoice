is-she-electable:
  question: ...is she even electable?
  answer: |
      We’ve never seen an election year like this. Jill is running against two
      major-party candidates that have the lowest favorability ratings in
      decades. Many Bernie Sanders supporters who are disillusioned after the DNC
      have flocked to Jill’s campaign to continue the political revolution.
      Campaign donations have exploded nearly 1000% since Sanders's endorsement
      of Clinton.

      When she polls at 15% in 5 national polls, Jill will be included in
      Presidential debates, at which point the  mainstream media will be
      compelled to increase coverage of her campaign. Americans will learn they
      have another choice that doesn’t involve voting for the lesser of two evils.
      Jill’s plan to cancel student debt for 43 million people alone would be a
      winning plurality, so getting the word out is key.

      Even if Jill doesn’t win, a vote for her [isn’t wasted]($wasted).

wont-she-be-a-spoiler:
  question: ...won't she be a spoiler like Ralph Nader?
  answer: |
    First of all, it's a myth that Nader spoiled the 2000 election. You can
    [read more]($medium) about that if you like, but for now let's talk about 2016.

    This year, governor Gary Johnson in the Libertarian Party is a right-wing
    third party candidate who is already siphoning a lot of conservative support
    from Donald Trump. In 2016, the spoiler argument is *even further* from the
    truth than it's ever been.

    Bernie Sanders inspired a movement of people who might not have ordinarily
    participated in the democratic process, many of them young people. Talk of a
    spoiler assumes the Democratic Party is automatically entitled to, or owns,
    their votes. It's the kind of arrogance that plagues the leadership of a
    morally decaying political party — but in 2016, they can't even pretend to
    have the numbers on their side. **You have nothing to fear from voting your
    conscience. A vote for Jill Stein is just that, a vote for Jill Stein.**

third-party-wasted-vote:
  question: ...isn't a third party vote a wasted vote?
  answer: |
    Party identification in 2016 is near [historic lows]($gallup) with Republicans at 26%
    and Democrats at 29%. With 42% of voters identifying as independents, this
    race is up for grabs. Voters are clamoring for more choices and this election
    may well signal the rise of third parties into political prominence.

    The presidency is won by electoral votes awarded by winning individual
    states. **If you live in a state that’s polling solid red or blue, then an
    additional vote for a Democrat or a Republican won’t change the outcome —
    expressing your support for a third party is actually *more* meaningful than a
    major party vote in these states!**

    ***Your vote isn’t wasted even if Jill doesn’t win.*** If the Green Party
    gets 5% of the popular vote, it qualifies for federal funding in the 2020
    election. Plus, the more votes Jill gets, the more publicity the party will
    get. If Jill loses but gets a good turnout, the media will run with the
    narrative that voters are rejecting the two-party system. We can use that to
    build a movement to win down-ticket races in the years to come.

isnt-she-anti-science:
  question: ...isn't she anti-science/anti-vaccine?
  answer: |
    Dr. Jill Stein is a [Harvard Medical School graduate]($heavy) who practiced medicine
    for 25 years. She supports vaccinations and considers them critical medication
    to rid us of many diseases. However, she has [spoken out]($pressrelease)
    about the corrupting influence of pharmaceutical industry lobbying, the FDA
    being controlled by drug companies, and the consequent erosion of public trust.

    Jill is absolutely pro-science, especially when it comes to climate change —
    she understands that the science says we need to do something now. She opposes
    fracking, offshore drilling, and other destructive energy extraction methods
    that are harmful to our climate and environment.

    Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, will gladly [pander to pro-science voters]($slate),
    but then turns around and [supports fracking]($grist). Anyone who understands
    the science knows there is [no such thing as "safe fracking"]($pnj). Climate
    change is [an emergency]($guardian), and nobody who truly believes in it
    should be dragging their feet on ditching fossil fuels.

# how-can-she-get-anything-done:
#     question: ...how can she get anything done with Democrats and Republicans?
#     answer: |
#       Jill aims to use the governance strategy that Barack Obama seemed to
#       promise in 2008 and didn’t deliver on: using the power of the people. She’s
#       [taken Obama to task]($intercept) for putting “his ground troops on the
#       shelf” — meaning the grassroots support he built — after getting elected.
#       Democracy doesn’t end when you cast a vote for President, and Jill wants
#       to be a commander-in-chief of citizens and activists, using protest and
#       grassroots organizing to put pressure on Congress to enact the policies we
#       voted for.
#
#       We’ve never had a President operate that way before, but in
#       the 21st century of hyperconnected citizens and disconnected elected
#       officials, it’s about time that we did.

how-will-she-pay-for-this:
    question: ...how will she pay for all this?
    answer: |
      Jill is calling for a Green New Deal, like the New Deal that got us out of
      the Great Depression in the 1930’s. This would take the form of an emergency
      jobs program that would create 25 million new green jobs, jobs focused on
      transitioning to 100% clean renewable energy by 2030. This would not only
      jumpstart our economy but also make wars for oil obsolete.

      By establishing a foreign policy based on diplomacy, international law, and
      human rights it would allow us to significantly reduce our military budget.
      Jill proposes cutting military spending by 50 percent and closing military
      bases overseas thereby reducing our involvement in international conflicts.

      Jill’s plan to cancel student loan debt for 43 million people would take a
      similar form to the financial industry bailout of 2008. Just as we bailed
      out the crooks on Wall Street who crashed the economy, Jill would use
      [quantitative easing]($counterpunch) to bail out the victims. This
      [wouldn’t cost taxpayers]($foxbusiness) but instead return $7 for every
      dollar spent in the form of increased economic participation by a segment
      of our population that has been crippled and held hostage by student loan debt.

why-support-green-party:
    question: ...why support the Green Party instead of reforming the Democrats?
    answer: |
      The fact is that both parties are beholden to the same corporate interests
      representing the fossil fuel industry, Wall Street, pharmaceutical, and war
      profiteers. While there have been ongoing efforts to reform the Democratic
      Party for many years, the recent attempts by progressives like Bernie Sanders
      to reform from within have met with resistance at every turn. As confirmed
      by Wikileaks, there has been corruption and collusion at highest levels of
      the DNC, to the detriment of the party and our democracy.

      The Green Party is in a unique position to represent the 99% by being the
      only party that does not accept corporate donations or donations from PACs.
      It's part of a grassroots global movement that values people, planet, and
      peace over profit. It's the largest progressive opposition party in the
      United States today, and with the infrastructure the Greens have already
      built for ballot access, it's the best chance we have to take down the
      two-party system from the left.

fear-voting:
    question: ...I'm still afraid of Trump. How do we make sure he doesn't win?
    answer: |
      **If Jill gets into the debates, *all bets are off.*** The race changes entirely,
      and anyone could win the election.

      If that doesn’t happen, we still want Jill to have all the votes she can get.
      As much as we don’t want Trump to win, we can’t let ourselves be extorted into
      voting for the “lesser evil” candidate.

      History has shown that this type of race to the bottom voting has delivered
      us more of the things we don’t want rather than the type of world we’d like
      to have. The truth is both [Trump and Clinton are terrible choices]($video)
      and neither deserves our vote.

      Regardless of what state you live in, a vote for Jill is a conscientious vote
      that will also strengthen the Green Party and help support down ticket
      candidates. We each have the power to make a difference; reject the politics of
      fear and together we can fight for the greater good one vote at a time.
